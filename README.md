The Truth Institute is an engaging game that blends elements from "Papers, Please!" and George Orwell's "1984." As a diligent worker in the Truth Institute, your primary task is to inspect media devices and eradicate illegal information. The game draws inspiration from the oppressive atmosphere of "1984" and the meticulous scrutiny of "Papers, Please." Although we considered various complex mechanics such as influencing the narrative and unlocking different endings, we ultimately focused on delivering fast, smooth gameplay with straightforward mechanics for an immersive experience.
